## Analysis of Findings

### Conflicts
- **Disclaimer and Warranty Coverage**: The DigitalCinemaDestinationsCorp agreement includes a comprehensive disclaimer that explicitly states the absence of warranties related to its services and information (Section 9.2). In contrast, the Cybergy Holdings Inc agreement's warranty clause is more succinct and does not detail multiple forms of implied warranties, thus providing less extensive coverage (Section 16.1).

### Similarities
- **Exclusion of Warranties**: Both agreements affirmatively state that neither party holds express or implied warranties regarding their services. DigitalCinemaDestinationsCorp provides a broader context in its disclaimer, while Cybergy directly states the lack of warranties without elaboration on different forms as seen in the other document.

### Differences
- **Depth of Disclaimer**: The DigitalCinemaDestinationsCorp agreement explicitly covers various implied warranties (of title, noninfringement, merchantability, and fitness for purpose), while Cybergy's agreement does not explicitly cover these different forms.
- **Limitation of Liability**: DigitalCinemaDestinationsCorp emphasizes the exclusion of liability for indirect damages across a wider range of scenarios (Section 10.5), while Cybergy's limitations on liability are also present but focused primarily on the absence of warranties and a narrower scope of potential damages.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights key distinctions and similarities in warranty and liability language between two affiliate agreements, underscoring the need for stakeholders to carefully consider the implications of such clauses when forming strategic business partnerships.
